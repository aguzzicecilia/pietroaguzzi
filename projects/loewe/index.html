                    play of contrast between the visual cleannes of artworks cut-outs and the rough aesthetic of the artists process.
                    The former are photographs shot by Charles Negre, while the latter are amateur videos shot on a phone. While the homepage works as 
                    a carousel of the artworks cut-outs floating in space, each of the artists pages is a narrative editorial
                    taking the user backwards: from the finished artwork, ready to be displayed, to the artist studio where the process is at the center,
                     featuring materials, tools and eventually the sounds of their work through onomatopoeia.</span>
